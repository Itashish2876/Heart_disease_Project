# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on health data such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical factors.

## 📊 Project Description

Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early prediction can save lives. This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and classify individuals into "Heart Disease" or "No Heart Disease" categories.

The dataset used in this project contains various health attributes (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.), and the model was trained using Logistic Regression to make predictions.
